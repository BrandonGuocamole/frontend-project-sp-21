Given more time, what would you have done differently?
I would have made sure that the website was responsive for mobile.

How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?
I didn't use a navigation package, but I did use a ternary to control navigation without having to hard code in anything.

Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
No.
